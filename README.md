# CPRG303-Assignment3
In the group project titled "Api Calls, List Management" for Assignment 3, our team developed a web application that automatically fetches and displays historical facts based on user-selected dates. We utilized the "Numbers API" from RapidAPI.com to provide the facts for specific days and months. The interface we created included input fields for both month and day, with an automatic trigger for the API call upon field updates. We also added a dropdown menu for the month to enhance user interaction, dynamically adjusting the API requests based on the user's selection. Throughout the project, we maintained rigorous version control on GitHub, ensuring that all team contributions were synchronized and documented. This project not only strengthened our skills in API integration and dynamic web development but also emphasized collaborative software development and project management.
